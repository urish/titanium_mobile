name: Titanium.App.Android.R
description: The Titanium binding of [Application Resources](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/index.html).  This gives you access to resources you have packaged for your own application.  If you want to access the system-wide Android `R`, use <Titanium.Android.R>.
extends: Titanium.Proxy
since: "1.5"
platforms: [android]
createable: false
notes: |
    These properties and sub-properties are queried directly against your Application's `R` class, and should have the same syntax.  For example, if you have a file `platform/android/res/drawable/icon.png` in your project, you could then access its integer id like this:
    
        var resid = Titanium.App.Android.R.drawable.icon;
