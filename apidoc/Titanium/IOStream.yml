examples:
  - title: write data to stream
    example: |
        
            var outBuffer = Ti.createBuffer({data: "write me"});
            var outStream = // stream object could be socket, file, buffer or blob
            
            var bytesWritten = outStream.write(outBuffer);  // writes entire buffer to stream
            Ti.API.info("Bytes written:" + bytesWritten);  // should be 8
            
            bytesWritten = outStream.write(outBuffer, 2, 5);  // only writes "ite m" to stream
            Ti.API.info("Bytes written:" + bytesWritten);  // should be 5

  - title: read data from stream
    example: |
        
            var inBuffer = Ti.createBuffer({length: 1024});
            
            // assume the inStream contains the string "hello world"
            var inStream = // stream object could be socket, file, buffer or blob
            
            var bytesRead = inStream.read(inBuffer);  // reads "hello world" from stream
            Ti.API.info("Bytes read:" + bytesRead);  // should be 11
            
            bytesRead = inStream.read(inBuffer, 2, 5);  // only reads "llo w" from stream
            Ti.API.info("Bytes read:" + bytesRead);  // should be 5
