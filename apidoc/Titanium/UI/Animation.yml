    example: |
        Create a simple animation and apply it to the view.  In this example, the view will animate from red to black to orange over 2 seconds.
        
            var view = Titanium.UI.createView({
               backgroundColor:'red'
            });
            var animation = Titanium.UI.createAnimation();
            animation.backgroundColor = 'black';
            animation.duration = 1000;
            var animationHandler = function() {
               animation.removeEventListener('complete',animationHandler);
               animation.backgroundColor = 'orange';
               view.animate(animation);
            };
            animation.addEventListener('complete',animationHandler);
            view.animate(animation);
