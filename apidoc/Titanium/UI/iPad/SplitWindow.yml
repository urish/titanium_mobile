    The SplitWindow inherits its methods and properties from <Titanium.UI.Window>.
    
    The `masterView` and `detailView` properties are required in the constructor of the SplitWindow and cannot be changed once set.
    
    The SplitWindow is a top-level window and cannot be contained within another window or view.
