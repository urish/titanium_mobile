events:
  - name: update
    description: fired when the accelerometer changes
    properties:
      - name: timestamp
        description: reference timestamp since the previous change. this is not a valid timestamp and should simply be used to determine the time between events and not an exact timestamp.

notes: >
    You'll want to be selective about turning on and off the device accelerometer.  It's recommended you 
    turn off the accelerometer when you're not using it.
    
    You can turn off the accelerometer by simply removing your event listener function. 
    
        Titanium.Accelerometer.removeEventListener('update',myFunction);

    You can turn it back on by re-adding the same function with `addEventListener`.
examples:
  - title: Basic Accelerometer Event
    example: |
        Adds an accelerometer update event listener which prints out the x, y and z axis as the 
        device is moved.  You should generally remove the event when not used to conserve device 
        resources.  If you do not have an active event listener, the accelerometer is turned off to 
        conserve device resources.
        
            Titanium.Accelerometer.addEventListener('update',function(e)
            {
                Ti.API.debug("accelerometer - x:"+e.x+",y:"+e.y+",z:"+e.z);
            });
